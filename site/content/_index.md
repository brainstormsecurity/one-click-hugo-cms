Pets welcome. 
intro:
    heading: Getting around
    text: The cottage is situated in rural Normandy so if you want to travel to see the sites, a car is advisable. However, the cottage is located on a country lane leading off the village square, so the bar, shop, and boulangerie are all in walking distance. There is a local taxi service, which we provide details for in our welcome pack.
